    ## The screams of a shared hosting database dying

    ### December 8th, 2013

    <div className="my-10 flex items-center justify-center">
        <img className="sm:w-6/6 md:h-[200px]" alt="Database table with a ton of rows" src={sharedDatabase.src} />
    </div>

    Old Drupal 5 installation that is getting bombarded by bots (botbarded?).  Outdated security methods, poor (or none at all) form validation.  This is just one table of the many that have been affected.  Drupal core can’t be updated, Modules can’t be updated.  At a certain point it’s just worth it to start over.

    Total database size before attempting to fix it is 6.2 GB.
